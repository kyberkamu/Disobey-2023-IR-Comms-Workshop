# Scenarios for Disobey 2023 Cyber IR Comms Workshop

All scenarios expect you to be the sole incident response (IR) handler in an organisation. The workshop is meant to give you an idea about the variety of scenarios you may encounter in different IR situations. You may not be the sole person working in your organisation, but you are now tasked in handling the IR and communicate about it. You will learn about common pitfalls in communication and what tropes to avoid in IR comms.

You can do it. That's why you're here.

## Working through the scenarios

### Part 1: Start from the first scenario. Read this to gain information and context where you are currently in. You may apply this context to your IRL organisation, but you can also roleplay any kind of environment you come up with.

### Part 2: Workshop task. You have to write something based on the context and the goals given in this part.

### Part 3: Use this template to help you carry your message in the scenario. You may also opt to write a message on your own.

### Context

Your boss thanks you for dealing with the incident so quickly. The customers are happy with the response they got from your boss, but still there should be a public blog post on your website to describe the incident and how you handled it.

With dread, you see your boss turn over to you, their eyes focusing through the pixelated Teams video call. They have some sales visits to make today, and task you to create a public blog post about the incident.

### Your task

**Create a public blog post on your organisation's website describing the incident.** You're sweating bullets. You've never written a public blog post about _anything_, let alone a cyber security incident. It's time to summarise the incident to the public, which may or may not create media interest as well. Stick to the same story you already wrote to your boss and the end user.

**Let them know**

- What kind of incident took place
- What the impact was for your organisation and your customers
- What actions did you take and what third party notifications took place (e.g. authorities, GDPR, police, local NCSC).

**Avoid**

- Tech jargon
- Blaming the user
- Lengthly explanations, keep it short
- Describing the attack as "highly sophisticated"

### Template no 3.

**Subject: Security indicent at {organisation, date}**

Recently, our organisation fell victim to a phishing attack on {date}.  As a result of this attack, emails with malicious attachments were sent out from our organisation to our customers and partners. We immediately launched an investigation and worked to contain the incident. We were able to identify the source of the attack and take action to prevent further spread. 

The National Cyber Security Centre is supporting the invesetigation of our incident {or other third party you're working with} and we have notified the local authorities {whom you've contacted during your initial incident}.

To prevent future incidents, we have taken several technical measures to improve our security posture. We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused to our customers, partners, and employees. We take security very seriously and are committed to taking all necessary steps to prevent future incidents.

#### Bonus task

**Summarise the blog post for your boss, who has to respond to a media interview about the incident.** You won the lottery on a quiet newsday, and the media found out about your incident. The first interview is a phone interview with a local paper, and your boss asked you to write up bullet points for the interview. Luckily you already have good notes about the incident and your previous communication, so you're up to the task.

If you are the one who needs to do the interview, don't panic. Stick to your bullets, and stick to one phrase you can always repeat if you get a surprise question. E.g. if the journalist asks whether Russian hackers were behind your breach or not, you can repeat this: "Our aim is to ensure our employees, customers and partners information is safe and that we can avoid similar incidents in the future."

It's ok to have a base statement with you to a media interview. You don't have to answer all questions that are asked. You can keep going back to the basic statement if you can't figure out anything else to say. It's okay. We might all be in that position one day.
