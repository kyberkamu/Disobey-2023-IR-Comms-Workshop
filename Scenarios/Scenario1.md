# Scenarios for Disobey 2023 Cyber IR Comms Workshop

All scenarios expect you to be the sole incident response (IR) handler in an organisation. The workshop is meant to give you an idea about the variety of scenarios you may encounter in different IR situations. You may not be the sole person working in your organisation, but you are now tasked in handling the IR and communicate about it. You will learn about common pitfalls in communication and what tropes to avoid in IR comms.

You can do it. That's why you're here.

## Working through the scenarios ##

### Part 1: Start here, the first scenario. Read this to gain information and context where you are currently in. You may apply this context to your IRL organisation, but you can also roleplay any kind of environment you come up with.

### Part 2: Workshop task. You have to write something based on the context and the goals given in this part.

### Part 3: Use this template to help you carry your message in the scenario. You may also opt to write a message on your own.

## Scenario: Notifying an end user

### Part 1. Context

You wake up in the morning, have a cup o joe. It was a bit bitter, just like this day almost ended up being.

The phone rings, it's the National Cyber Security Center. You first think it's a random cyber salesman and almost hang up, but they catch you by mentioning something about a weird email coming from your organisation's address. It seems that a user in your organisation has been compromised, and malspam is now flying out from their inbox like no tomorrow. Seems like the user was caught up in the latest campaign, fresh out of the cyberz, and now local organisations from the same industry have reported the emails to the NCSC. Some of the emails even reached local government office inboxes, luckily not causing any trouble. Still, wide enough to be caught by the NCSC.

You cuss under your breath, probably knowing who it is. You thank the NCSC officer as you assure them that you've got it covered.

Another cup of coffee. Another sigh. Time to do your thing, open up that admin panel and see what you can do to remediate the effect of the ongoing incident.

*time goes by*

Stopping the malware and pushing the unwanted invader out of your email system is done. 

Now what's left is to tell your user what happened and how to prevent it in the future.

You feel frustrated, annoyed that you got a call from the NCSC about this particular case, since you've tried so hard to tell users not to give out their credentials and be wary of odd looking URLs and login pages. Definitely asking them not to download weird files from email nor the Internet. 

Sure, this particular case had an inviting looking message from a familiar sender, asking the user to login to view a shared file. The login page had all the right graphics and everything, and it the URL was the same as in all the other reported cases you heard about in Part 1. For some reason the URL was not caught by the automatic email scanner.

### Part 2. Your task

**Write an email to the original victim in your organisation.** You don't have all the details figured out, but you know the user got an email from a regular contact, tried to log in to view a document, and ended up sending out malware to all their contacts.

The user is scared this will impact their job, and they are worried about losing their position. They feel embarrassed, and were too scared to tell anyone about the suspicious page before things got out of hand.

**Let them know**

- The incident has been handled
- How they can be avoided in the future
- Who to contact if they see suspicious emails or URLs in the future

**Avoid**

- Blaming the victim
- Causing more alarm and creating more stress

### Part 3. Template no 1.

**Full email template:**

Dear {user},

The incident regarding your email account has been resolved. 

- You can now login again. 
- You will be instructed to reset your password at your next login.
- Malicious emails can suddenly arrive even from familiar contacts. Please look out for any abnormal emails also in the future.

An outsider was able to enter your email account by phishing your credentials with a realistic looking email login page. The outsider then sent out malicious emails to your contacts, which we have instructed not to open the messages. 

Part of my work is to help the organisation prevent these cases in the future. If you see something suspicious in your email, even from a familiar contact, please report it to me. You can always reach me directly on {system name} or via email. I'm happy to help.

Best,
{Your name}
