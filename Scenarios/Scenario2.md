# Scenarios for Disobey 2023 Cyber IR Comms Workshop

All scenarios expect you to be the sole incident response (IR) handler in an organisation. The workshop is meant to give you an idea about the variety of scenarios you may encounter in different IR situations. You may not be the sole person working in your organisation, but you are now tasked in handling the IR and communicate about it. You will learn about common pitfalls in communication and what tropes to avoid in IR comms.

You can do it. That's why you're here.

## Working through the scenarios
