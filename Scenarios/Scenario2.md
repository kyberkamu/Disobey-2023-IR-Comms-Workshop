# Scenarios for Disobey 2023 Cyber IR Comms Workshop

All scenarios expect you to be the sole incident response (IR) handler in an organisation. The workshop is meant to give you an idea about the variety of scenarios you may encounter in different IR situations. You may not be the sole person working in your organisation, but you are now tasked in handling the IR and communicate about it. You will learn about common pitfalls in communication and what tropes to avoid in IR comms.

You can do it. That's why you're here.

## Working through the scenarios

### Part 1: Start from the first scenario. Read this to gain information and context where you are currently in. You may apply this context to your IRL organisation, but you can also roleplay any kind of environment you come up with.

### Part 2: Workshop task. You have to write something based on the context and the goals given in this part.

### Part 3: Use this template to help you carry your message in the scenario. You may also opt to write a message on your own.

## 2. 

### You notified the end user about the incident (Scenario 1). Your boss has received some questions from outside of your organisation about the incident, and is asking you to explain the recent developments of the incident. The NCSC reached out back to you and said the original phishing domains had been taken down, reassuring you that currently there are no more victims that could come out of the same campaign. The malware sent out from your organisation was still being figured out.

In your small organisation, it's your boss who handles most of the things. Customer enquiries, sales, website, the whole works. Now it's time for you to summarise to them what happened in the latest incident, so you have a baseline for communicating the scope and impact of the incident. 

### Your task

**Write and email to your organisation's boss.** You know most of the incident has been handled, and the immediate danger has passed. 

The boss will have to know what to tell the customers about the incident, and what the impact to your organisation was. 

**Let them know**

- How the incident started
- What the impact was for your organisation
- Should customers be worried about their data

**Avoid**

- Tech jargon
- Lengthly explanations, keep it short

### Template no 2.
